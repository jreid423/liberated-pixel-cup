This archive contains submissions from the art phase of the Liberated
Pixel Cup 2012.


What is LPC?
------------

Liberated Pixel Cup is a two-part competition: make a bunch of
awesome free culture licensed artwork, and then program a bunch of
free software games that use it.

  http://lpc.opengameart.org/

Liberated Pixel Cup tries to make it easier for artists to collaborate
by defining a specific style that artists can collaborate on.
Consider checking out the guide here:

  http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/index.html

... it includes a mini html5 "walkaround" game, and so is in that
sense at least worth your time. ;)

This archive contains all qualified submissions to Liberated Pixel Cup
(as well as a few non-participating entries that fit the style well),
as well as the base assets (stored in the base_assets/ directory).

Have fun!
