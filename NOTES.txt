Basically what we have to do:

generateTileChunk needs to look
at the patches near it to see
if there's any tiles that need
to be rendered, if not, render
the main tile

So to do that we have to grab
patches that are in the chunk


BEST SOLUTION:

Rewrite the constructor to
TilePatch so that it can accept
it's coordinates, then grab any
nearby patches and let the patch
handle whether the tile you're
looking for is inside

OTHER SOLUTION

Grab nearby tiles, calculate
their offset, and handle the
tile search manually
